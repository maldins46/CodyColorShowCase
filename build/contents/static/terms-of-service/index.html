                        <b>Conditions of use:</b>
                        Access to the CodyColor game is offered to you for free.
                        No registration is required and no personal information is stored in order to provide access to the service.
                        Further information is available in our <a href="../privacy-policy">Privacy policy</a>.
                        No guarantees are given about availability and quality of the service.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Behavior:</b>
                        The CodyColor game gives access to shared game rooms that allow limited interactions between players in order to provide a simultaneous game experience.
                        Players may communicate through limited means and agree to be subject to basic decency rules during these interactions: rude, malicious, or unacceptable behavior (as determined unilaterally by the service providers) is not allowed.
                        If players persist in unacceptable behavior, access to the service may be denied by the service providers.
                    </p>
